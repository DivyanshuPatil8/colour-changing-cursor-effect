# colour-changing-cursor-effect
This code changes your cursor's color as you move it around the screen, making it look more colorful. When you move the mouse faster, the cursor gets bigger. It also creates small trails behind the cursor that slowly fade away, adding a fun effect that makes the cursor feel more dynamic and interactive.
